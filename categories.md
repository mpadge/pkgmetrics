Categories which arise from analyses of JOSS abstracts yet do not emerge from
these conference programs include:

- workflow
- exploratory data analysis
- summary statistics
- statistical reporting

Each of the items listed below is followed by a sub-list of aspects of software
and associated algorithms which may be assessed or compared with some kind of
standards.
